# ML-DL-based-on-Image-Classification-using-CIFAR10-dataset-

- The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60000 32x32 colour images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. * There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images.
- Data set has been analysed with few EDA techniques, applied PCA, predicted using Machine learning algorithms (Random Forest, KNN, Logistic Regression, SVM).
- Also implemented Deep learning methods like 2DCNN and DNN. Predictions has been done on the test data and the results which obtained were very good in identifying the images with better accuracy results than ML methods.

Please go through the python files, for the better understanding.
